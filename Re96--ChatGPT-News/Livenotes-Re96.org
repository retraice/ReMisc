  impact on businesses. In economic terms, when the cost curves shift downward
  on a primary factor of production in an industry, big-time change is in store
  for that industry.11 Today, three factors of production have become
  cheaper—information, connectivity, and computing power—affecting any cost
  curves in which those factors are involved. This can’t help but have
  disruptive effects. Many incumbents—aka pre-Internet companies—built their
  businesses based on assumptions of scarcity: scarce information, scarce
  distribution resources and market reach, or scarce choice and shelf
  space. Now, though, these factors are abundant, lowering or eliminating
  barriers to entry and making entire industries ripe for change.12 We

        path('', views.index, name='index'),
    ]

    # myapp/index.html

    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

  #+end_src

  This example demonstrates the basic structure of a Django website. It includes a
  single app called "myapp" with a single view and template. The view simply
  renders the template, which displays a simple "Hello, world!" message.

  To run this example, you will need to have Django installed and set up a new
  Django project and app. You will also need to include the app in the
  INSTALLED_APPS list in settings.py and add its URLs to the project's urlpatterns
  list in urls.py.

  I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further
  assistance.
